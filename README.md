# Python Network Simulator

## About
A custom python network simulator for use with custom routing protocols. Designed with extensibility and simplicity in mind, it serves as a foundation for experimenting with various routing algorithms and networking concepts.

## Features
- **Router Simulation**: Simulate individual routers with unique identifiers, routing tables, and neighbor information.
- **Routing Protocols**: Easily plug in custom routing protocols for experimentation and learning.
- **Timers**: Implement timing mechanisms for different protocols like RIP.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/python-network-simulator.git
cd python-network-simulator
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Usage
Run the main file to start the simulation:
```bash
python main.py
```
